# dff2dsfTool
This tool does nothing on its own and needs you to have [Signalyst's DFF2DSF command line conversion utility](https://www.signalyst.com/professional.html).
The reason I made this tool is to speed up the process of using their tool and also add the ability to convert multiple files at a time.

# Usage
*Select dff2dsf.exe path* - Select your dff2dsf.exe. Its path will automatically be saved within this Tool (for later use) and will be displayed in the label on the left. Note that you can click the label in order to open the path in the explorer.

*Select DFF file(s)* - Select one or multiple .dff files. If you have selected only one file, its path will be displayed on the left label. If you have selected multiple files you will have to hover over the label to see a list of files selected.

*Select Destination Folder* - Select the folder where you want the files to go. Its path will be displayed on the left label.

*Go* - Use the above provided paths to run the dff2dsf program. Note that if you have selected multiple files, multiple cmd windows will open.
